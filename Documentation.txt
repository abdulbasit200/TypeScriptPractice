What is TypeScript?
	Prgramming language to address short comings of JavaScript.
	Programing language build on top of JavaScript. JavaScript is subset of TypeScript.

Benifits?
	Static typing
	Code completion
	Refactoring
	Shorthand Notaions

Static type:
	Data type difine on Compile time.
	(C++, C#, Java)
	int number = 10;	(Right)
	number = "a";		(Wrong)
Dynamic Type:
	Data type difine on Run time.
	(JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
	let number = 10;	(Right)
	number = "a";		(Right)

Drawbacks?
	Compilation
	Discipline in coding.
	
Transpilation:
	Processs of compiling TypeScript into JavaScript.
	
JavaScriptis best for simple projects. TypeScript is best for medium to large projects.
